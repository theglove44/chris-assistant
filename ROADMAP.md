## Capabilities

The bot currently has one tool (`update_memory`). Everything below expands what it can actually do.

| # | Impact | Status | Item | Description |
|---|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | 🔴 | ⬜ | **Web search tool** | No access to real-time information (news, weather, prices, URLs). Every factual answer relies on training data with a knowledge cutoff. Adding a web search tool (e.g. Brave Search, Tavily, or SearXNG) makes the bot genuinely useful for day-to-day questions. |
| 2 | 🟠 | ⬜ | **Image and document handling** | Telegram supports photos, PDFs, voice messages, locations. The bot only handles `message:text` — everything else is silently ignored. At minimum, support photos via vision APIs (all three providers support image inputs) and document text extraction. |
| 3 | 🟠 | ⬜ | **File and URL reading** | No ability to fetch a URL you paste in chat or read a file you send. A simple HTTP fetch tool would cover link previews, article summaries, and checking endpoints. |
| 4 | 🟡 | ⬜ | **Code execution sandbox** | If asked to run code or verify output, the bot can only guess. A sandboxed execution environment (e.g. a Docker container, or a tool that runs code snippets) would let it actually test and validate code. |
| 5 | 🟢 | ⬜ | **Calendar/reminder integration** | No awareness of time, dates, or schedules. Can't set reminders or check what's on today. Would require an external integration (Google Calendar API, Apple Reminders, etc.). |

## User Experience

How the bot feels to use day-to-day.

| # | Impact | Status | Item | Description |
|---|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | 🔴 | ⬜ | **Streaming responses** | User sees "typing..." until the full response is generated. Reasoning models (o3) can take 30+ seconds. Telegram supports progressive updates via `editMessageText` — send a partial response and keep updating it as tokens stream in. Night-and-day improvement. |
| 2 | 🟠 | ⬜ | **Persistent conversation history** | 20 messages, in-memory, lost on every restart. The bot can't recall yesterday's conversation. Store conversations in SQLite or the memory repo so context survives restarts and the bot can reference past chats. |
| 3 | 🟠 | ⬜ | **MarkdownV2 rendering** | Currently using legacy `parse_mode: "Markdown"` which breaks on common characters (`.`, `!`, `-`, `(`, `)`). Many responses silently fall back to plain text via the catch handler. Switching to MarkdownV2 with proper escaping fixes formatting reliability. |
| 4 | 🟡 | ⬜ | **Voice message support** | Telegram voice messages are common on mobile. Transcribe incoming voice via Whisper API or similar, and optionally respond with TTS audio. |
| 5 | 🟢 | ⬜ | **Telegram commands menu** | Only `/start` and `/clear` exist. Could add `/model` (show/switch model), `/memory` (show memory status), `/forget` (clear a specific memory) accessible directly from Telegram without the CLI. |

## Reliability

Keeping the bot running and recovering from failures.

| # | Impact | Status | Item | Description |
|---|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | 🔴 | ⬜ | **Health check and alerting** | No monitoring beyond manual `chris status`. If the bot crashes or an API token expires, nobody knows until a message goes unanswered. Add a periodic health ping (e.g. the bot messages you if it restarts, or a cron job that checks pm2 status and alerts via Telegram). |
| 2 | 🟠 | ⬜ | **Graceful error recovery** | If a provider fails mid-conversation (token expired, API down), the bot returns a generic error. Could auto-retry with exponential backoff, or fall back to a different provider. |
| 3 | 🟡 | ⬜ | **Token expiry monitoring** | MiniMax tokens expire after a few hours with no auto-refresh. OpenAI tokens auto-refresh but the refresh token itself could expire. `chris doctor` checks these, but the bot should proactively warn when tokens are about to expire. |
| 4 | 🟡 | ⬜ | **Conversation history backup** | In-memory history is lost on crash. Even before building persistent storage, periodically flushing recent conversation to disk (or the memory repo) would prevent total context loss. |

## Security

Protecting the bot, its tokens, and the memory repo.

| # | Impact | Status | Item | Description |
|---|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | 🟠 | ⬜ | **Rate limiting** | No throttle on incoming messages. A compromised Telegram session could flood the API. Add a simple per-minute rate limit in `telegram.ts` (e.g. max 10 messages/minute, queue or reject beyond that). |
| 2 | 🟠 | ⬜ | **Prompt injection defense** | A crafted message could manipulate the bot into overwriting memory files with malicious content via `update_memory`. Add validation on memory tool inputs (e.g. reject writes that contain suspicious patterns, limit write size, require confirmation for destructive actions like overwriting identity files). |
| 3 | 🟡 | ⬜ | **Token file permissions** | `~/.chris-assistant/*.json` files containing OAuth tokens are readable by any process running as the user. Set file permissions to `0600` on write. Low risk on a personal Mac Mini, but good hygiene. |
| 4 | 🟢 | ⬜ | **Error message leakage** | Provider catch blocks log full errors to console. If error handling changes, stack traces or API details could accidentally leak to Telegram. Ensure user-facing error messages never include raw error details. |

## Architecture

Structural improvements that enable future work.

| # | Impact | Status | Item | Description |
|---|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | 🔴 | ⬜ | **Tool framework** | Currently tools are hardcoded per-provider. Adding a second tool means updating all three providers. Build a shared tool registry so new tools (web search, code exec, etc.) are defined once and automatically available to all providers. |
| 2 | 🟡 | ⬜ | **Plugin/middleware system** | Features like rate limiting, input sanitization, logging, and response post-processing (think tag stripping) are all inline in `telegram.ts`. A middleware pipeline would make these composable and testable. |
| 3 | 🟢 | ⬜ | **Multi-chat support** | The user guard allows one user, but conversation history is keyed by `chatId`. The architecture almost supports group chats or multiple users, but the guard and system prompt assume single-user. Worth deciding if this should be a deliberate constraint or an extensibility point. |
